## Linear SVM
- 좋은 분류기 -> 각 마진이 최대가 되는 지점.
- 경계위의 점 -> Support vector
### Suppose Linearly separable is no possible

Problem of hard margin classification
- It only work if the data is `linearly separable`
- It is sensitive to outliers.

`To avoid there issus`, Let's use a more flexible model
- The objective is to find a good balance between keeping the `street` as large as paossible and limiting the margin violations.

--> `Soft margin classification`.
